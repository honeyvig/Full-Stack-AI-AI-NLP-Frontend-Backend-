# Full-Stack-AI-AI-NLP-Frontend-Backend
We’re building a cutting-edge AI sales agent that can autonomously handle video conference sales calls, answer questions, manage objections, and seamlessly integrate with tools like HubSpot and major video platforms (Zoom/Google Meet). The goal is to create a company-agnostic AI solution that can be trained and customized for different businesses.

We’re looking for a talented developer who can bring the entire vision to life—from AI model integration to real-time video/voice functionalities and CRM connections.

Role Overview:

As a Full-Stack AI Developer, you’ll take full ownership of building this AI-powered sales agent. You’ll design, build, and integrate everything—AI model processing, backend APIs, frontend interfaces (video avatars), and HubSpot CRM functionality. This is a hands-on role for a developer excited about AI-driven innovation.

Responsibilities:

AI/NLP Development

- Integrate and fine-tune models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4 API or Hugging Face) for natural language processing.
- Enable the AI to handle live conversations, contextual memory, and FAQs dynamically.

Backend Development

- Build scalable APIs (using FastAPI or Flask) for real-time communication and integrations.
- Implement speech-to-text (Whisper) and text-to-speech (ElevenLabs) processing.
- Integrate HubSpot CRM for lead management, conversation logging, and follow-ups.

Frontend Development

- Develop a visual layer using tools like Synthesia/D-ID for realistic AI avatars.
- Implement the agent’s real-time interface for platforms like Zoom and Google Meet.

Platform Integration

- Integrate with video conferencing platforms (Zoom/Google Meet APIs).
- Ensure smooth workflows for scheduling, escalations, and call follow-ups.

Testing and Deployment

- Optimize for real-time performance and low latency.
- Deploy the agent using AWS (or Azure) with scalability in mind.

Requirements:

AI/NLP Experience: Proven experience with OpenAI GPT APIs, Hugging Face Transformers, or other conversational AI frameworks.

Backend Skills: Strong proficiency in Python (FastAPI, Flask) for building APIs.

Frontend Skills: Experience with JavaScript frameworks (React or Vue.js).

Integration Expertise: Familiarity with HubSpot CRM APIs and video platform APIs (Zoom, Google Meet).

Speech & Video Integration: Knowledge of text-to-speech tools (e.g., ElevenLabs) and video avatar tools (e.g., Synthesia, D-ID).

Deployment: Experience deploying scalable solutions on AWS, Docker, or Kubernetes.

Communication: Ability to collaborate, ask the right questions, and deliver independently.

Bonus Skills (Nice-to-Have)

- Experience with LangChain for building multi-step conversational agents.
- Familiarity with tools like Zapier for additional workflow automation.
- Knowledge of real-time data streaming (e.g., WebSockets).

Why You Should Apply

- End-to-End Ownership: Take full ownership of an innovative AI project from inception to deployment.
- Innovation-Focused: Work with cutting-edge AI models, real-time video/voice technologies, and CRM integrations.
- Future-Proof Opportunity: Build a scalable, company-agnostic product that can transform sales automation for businesses globally.
- Flexible Work: Remote role with flexibility in work hours.

Compensation

- Competitive project-based pay or contract terms.
- Future opportunities for potential cofounder/company equity

How to Apply

- Submit your resume with links to relevant projects, GitHub repositories, or live demos.
- Share a brief paragraph on your experience building end-to-end AI applications.
- Include any specific experience with HubSpot, video APIs, or speech tools (like ElevenLabs).

Key Features of the Code:

    AI/NLP Integration:
        OpenAI GPT-4 is used for conversational AI. The process_ai_message function sends a prompt to the OpenAI API and receives a response.
        Whisper by OpenAI is used for speech-to-text processing. The speech_to_text function converts audio files into text, which can then be processed by GPT-4.

    Backend API with FastAPI:
        FastAPI serves as the backend to handle real-time requests from video call clients (via WebSockets) and to process user messages sent via HTTP POST.
        WebSocket integration allows for continuous, real-time communication with the AI sales agent.

    CRM Integration (HubSpot):
        A function, log_to_hubspot, logs the conversation into HubSpot CRM, associating the user’s messages with their profile in the CRM system for lead tracking and follow-up.

    Video and Speech Integration:
        While Zoom or Google Meet APIs are typically used to integrate video conferencing features, this part is represented here with a simulated function, simulate_video_integration.
        Speech-to-text functionality is handled with the Whisper model, and text-to-speech can be implemented with services like ElevenLabs for generating AI responses.

    Deployment:
        The application uses FastAPI for handling API endpoints and WebSocket for real-time communications.
        To deploy the system, you would use services like AWS or Docker to containerize the application and ensure scalability.

Next Steps and Technologies:

    Video Integration:
        You would integrate APIs for video platforms such as Zoom or Google Meet to manage scheduling, joining calls, and handling video feeds.

    AI Fine-Tuning:
        To ensure the AI model handles business-specific queries, you would fine-tune OpenAI GPT-4 or Hugging Face models with domain-specific data (e.g., sales pitches, objections).

    Real-Time Performance:
        For real-time performance, WebSockets and low-latency communication are critical. You can optimize the backend for performance, possibly using WebRTC for real-time video streaming.

    User Feedback:
        For improving the system, you might collect user feedback after each interaction to train the AI further and refine its responses.

Deployment Considerations:

    AWS: Use EC2 or Lambda to host the backend services. Elastic Beanstalk or ECS for containerized deployments.
    Docker: Containerize the backend for portability and scalability across environments.
    Kubernetes: If required, use Kubernetes for scaling services automatically based on traffic.

This Python-based architecture provides a robust foundation for creating an AI-driven sales agent, integrating with video conferencing platforms, handling speech processing, and connecting with CRMs like HubSpot.
